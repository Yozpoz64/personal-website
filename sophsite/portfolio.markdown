Here you can find some examples of my work. To get the most recent projects I am working on, or some more in-depth information, send me an email or check out my GitHub :)

<h4>Cartography</h4>
Here are a couple of examples of my cartographic skills. This first map was the result of a series of multi-criteria evaluations into the expansion of the agricultural and carpet industries in Kathmandu:

This map was created to show the pedestrian catchment for Mt Eden train station using advanced network analysis techniques:

<h4>Reports</h4>
I have worked with big data to find the correlation between the [extent of polar sea ice and tsunami events](/assets/portfolio/lab1report.pdf). This was my first endevour in big data analysis. I have also analyzed the [factors affecting AirBnb properties in Christchurch](/assets/portfolio/lab2report.pdf). This involved geospatial servers, webmapping and more.

<h4>Web Mapping</h4>
For a Stage III GIS programming course I created a dashboard tool for looking at fine-grained mobility from the GeoLife dataset. You can access everything I worked on, including the code and project report, on my <a href="https://github.com/Yozpoz64/geolife-dashboard">GitHub</a>. Below is a short recording of me going through some random users:

Another project I worked on for GIS programming was a webmap of the factors influencing the price of short-term accommodation. It shows some statistics of AirBnb properties by SA2 unit (joined with Otago Deprivation Index) in Christchurch. AirBnb data are from a 2016 scrape. Have a look:

<h4>Virtual Reality Development</h4>
The work I do for VR systems and software is currently under a non-disclosure agreement. You can have a look at [this blog post](https://locative.dev/2021/03/03/My-Summer-VR-Locative-Reality/) I wrote earlier in 2021 about my time learning Unity and VR dev. I am also able to share this old dev video (I have since re-built the software from the ground-up):
