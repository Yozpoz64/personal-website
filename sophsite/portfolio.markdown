A work in progress...

<h4>Lab Reports</h4>
In GISCI 242 I performed a multi-criteria evalutation to assess the viability of agricultural and economic development of some parcels of land.
[You can access the corresponding report here](/assets/portfolio/242_lab2_samkolston.pdf).

In GISCI 343 I worked with big data to find the correlation between the [extent of polar sea ice and tsunami events](/assets/portfolio/lab1report.pdf). I also analyzed the [factors affecting AirBnb properties in Christchurch](/assets/portfolio/lab2report.pdf).

<h4>Code</h4>
more to come...

<h4>Web Mapping</h4>
Here is a selected webmap from my GISCI343 lab 2 report. It shows some statistics of AirBnb properties by SA2 unit (joined with Otago Deprivation Index) in Christchurch. AirBnb data are from a 2016 scrape.
