I have set up the GIS helpdesk (with a lot of help) after noticing that students often have problems in their labs and coursework that lead to a lot of stress. Stress sucks. The helpdesk serves as a less formal lab session where anyone can come and get their problems fixed by myself and anyone else who wants to pitch in. If you want more information about the helpdesk, whether you need help or want to provide it, please send me an email :)

We never want students to stress. This is pretty unavoidable at uni, but hopefully donating some spare time to things like this will help people focus on the fun parts of GIS rather than spending all of their down time trying to connect to FlexIT.

Thanks to Gina, Rachel, Amber, Sila and everyone else who helped us sort out the room booking, advertising, and coming to the sessions to help out.
