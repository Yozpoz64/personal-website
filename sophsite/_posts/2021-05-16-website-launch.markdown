Hello, world!

Welcome to my website. Created to share some of the projects I am working on for a mixture of narcissism and self-fulfillment (which are very much not mutually exclusive).

You can find out about me in the <a href="/about">about</a> section.

I created this site using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs">Jekyll</a> Markdown system, which is pretty straightforward and lets you not bother around with CSS. This is the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">minima</a> theme.
