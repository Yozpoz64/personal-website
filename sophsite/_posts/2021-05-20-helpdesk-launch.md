I am pleased to say that the first couple of GIS Heldesk sessions were very successful!

You can find more about what we aim to achieve with the Helpdesk on its very own [page](/helpdesk.html). Long story short, we are trying to build a community for support in the GIS programme, and so far it's going really well.

Students from all levels of ability and backgrounds came along to seek and deliver GIS help. It was really fulfilling to give help on PhD projects that were tackling interesting problems. Also, thanks to RTEA for funding snacks for the sessions :)
