<h1>Sophie Kolston (she/her)</h1>
Kia ora! I am an undergraduate Geographic Information Science student, studying at the University of Auckland. My research interests currently revolve around virtual reality for qualitative GIS, with this project focussing on the spread of Kauri Dieback, with Dr Michael Martin. I also tutor GISCI242 (Principles of GIScience).
