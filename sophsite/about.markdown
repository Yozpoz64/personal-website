<h1>Sophie Kolston (she/her)</h1>
Kia ora! I am an undergraduate Geographic Information Science (GIS) student studying at the University of Auckland. My research interests currently revolve around free and open-source development for GIS. I am tutoring Environmental Science 203 (Environmental Modelling), and am starting as a Graduate Spatial Advisor with Abley in November.
