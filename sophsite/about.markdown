<h3>Kia ora!</h3>
My name is Sophie (she/her). I am a modelling and GIS nerd who is particularly interested in complex systems science. 

I originally studied GIS at university, then realised my true passion lies in environmental modelling. Previously I have worked in GIS research and as a spatial advisor for a transport consultancy. At the moment I am working as researcher/tutor, and I will be beginning an MSc in coastal modelling in 2023.

This blog is as a way for me to post interesting things I take part in, but ends up mainly serving as an outlet for me to complain about bad GIS (and other things) I find in the wild :)
